            <p style="color:aqua; background-color: antiquewhite; font-size:50px;">Element Selector is my favourite type of selecter, this is because it is simple to use and can be understood easily unlike the other selectors.</p>

            <p id="para">id selecter is honestly a bit unique according to me because it uses # according to me its a unique symbol and yeah i do also like it overall.</p>
